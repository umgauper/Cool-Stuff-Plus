        <p id="about">My interest in refrigeration primarily began when I was a business partner in a seafood business in St. Louis, Mo. There are few businesses that rely on refrigeration as much as a seafood business. We had over-the-road refrigerated trucks, ice machines, walk-in coolers and freezers, refrigerated display coolers and deli-cases. Our company even had a huge refrigerated commercial sized lobster holding tank. Since we were always calling the refrigeration service guy to come fix our equipment, I figured I should learn how to fix the equipment myself.
            Since leaving the seafood industry I have worked as a service technician for a beverage supply company, a used restaurant supply company and for a government contractor on an Air Force base. I know many tricks-of-trade and hope to pass some of that knowledge on.
            While working at the beverage supply company, I was quite intrigued about how beverage-dispensing systems work and am working on a fairly simple system to dispense beverages in your home. Not only will this save you money, but increase the variety of beverages available considerably.
            Thank you for visiting. And &#8230; Keep cool!
